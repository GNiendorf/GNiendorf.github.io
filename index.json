The Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) is designed to measure missing momentum in high-rate electron fixed-target reactions with beam energies of 4 GeV to 16 GeV. A prerequisite for achieving several important sensitivity milestones is the capability to efficiently reject backgrounds associated with few-GeV bremsstrahlung, by twelve orders of magnitude, while maintaining high efficiency for signal. The primary challenge arises from events with photo-nuclear reactions faking the missing-momentum property of a dark matter signal. We present a methodology developed for the LDMX detector concept that is capable of the required rejection. By employing a detailed GEANT4-based model of the detector response, we demonstrate that the sampling calorimetry proposed for LDMX can achieve better than $10textasciicircum-13$ rejection of few-GeV photons. This suggests that the luminosity-limited sensitivity of LDMX can be realized at 4 GeV and higher beam energies.","tags":["High Energy Physics - Experiment","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics - Instrumentation and Detectors"],"title":"A High Efficiency Photon Veto for the Light Dark Matter eXperiment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Torsten Åkesson","Asher Berlin","Nikita Blinov","Owen Colegrove","Giulia Collura","Valentina Dutta","Bertrand Echenard","Joshua Hiltbrand","David G.

LDMX employs missing momentum and energy techniques in multi-GeV electro-nuclear fixed-target collisions to explore couplings to electrons in uncharted regions that extend down to and below levels that are motivated by direct thermal freeze-out mechanisms. LDMX would also be sensitive to a wide range of visibly and invisibly decaying dark sector particles, thereby addressing many of the science drivers highlighted in the 2017 US Cosmic Visions New Ideas in Dark Matter Community Report. LDMX would achieve the required sensitivity by leveraging existing and developing detector technologies from the CMS, HPS and Mu2e experiments. In this paper, we present our initial design concept, detailed GEANT-based studies of detector performance, signal and background processes, and a preliminary analysis approach. We demonstrate how a first phase of LDMX could expand sensitivity to a variety of light dark matter, mediator, and millicharge particles by several orders of magnitude in coupling over the broad sub-GeV mass range.","tags":["Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","High Energy Physics - Experiment","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics - Instrumentation and Detectors"],"title":"Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX)","type":"publication"}]
